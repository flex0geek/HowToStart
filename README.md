# HowToStart

## Web Pen-Tesing
  - Learning Programing language (PHP, JS, MySQL)
    - PHP: it will help to understand the applications so you should know it well
    - JS: It will not just help you with JS and making new payloads, but it will make you to dig deep with the JS files it will give you some Cool things.
    - MySQL: this will help to understand the SQL injection and making right queries when you trying to exploit.
  - Understand the vulnerabilities
    - You should know what is the vulnerability, What Code makes this vulnerability, How to find this vulnerability in Applications, and How to solve it.
  - Practice

    - [Hacker101](https://www.hacker101.com/)
    - [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/)
    - [Pentester Lab](https://pentesterlab.com/)
  - Playing CTF
    - CTFs is have some real world examples for a vulnerabilities or CVEs or some new exploits you will know from it.
  - Do some Bug Hunting and this website will help [BugBountyHunter](https://bugbountyhunter.com/).
    - Watch this [Methodology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIz_yn0Uvb8) by [Jason Haddix](https://twitter.com/jhaddix).
    - Initially, you can start with hunting on programs that offer points to gain experience.
  - You can take eWAPTx & eWAPT
    - eWAPT: it will be a good one in the beginning because it has some basics about Web Pen-Testing.
    - eWAPTx: this one is advanced one you can start with it when you be at least good with the vulnerabilities and the matriales in eWAPT.
  - You can take OSWE But it is advanced and need Code Review Skills.

    - This will help you to understand the vulnerabilities, how to send a right report, and will Bug Hunting live.

## Network Pentesing
  - Network+
    - It will make you understand network, Design and implement functional networks, and implement network security standard and protocols.
  - Linux+
    - You will understand linux and how to use it from this course.
  - [TCM TheCyberMentor](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/) Course
  - Scripting with Python or Bash
    - Use any scripting language it will be you with automation.
  - Understanding Operating systems windows/linux (You can take OS course)
    - taking a OS course it will make you understand the OS kernal and Memory Management.
  - Good course for Privilege escalation for [linux](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxprivescarena) & [Windows](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/TryHackMe-Windows-PrivEsc-Arena)
  - Practice (it will be hard at first but after some tries, it will be okay)
    - Solve machines on [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) 
    - Solve machines on [Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/)
  - [The Cyber Mentor Network Pentesting Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLKT__MCUeiwBa7d7F_vN1GUwz_2TmVQj)
  - Basic knowledge of Reverse Engineering
  - Certificates
    - PTS (Beginners)
    - PTP
    - PTX
    - OSCP

## Mobile Pentesting
  - Basics of Linux (you can use this [Book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jvphfw61odAcGixV7erYcRui2Iz9tjAu/view))
  - eMAPT Course (Its very basics)
    - This is not the best one but it will give you the first step but it's not all think
  - SEC575 from SANS
  - FOR585 from SANS
  - Good [Blog](http://blog.itselectlab.com/?page_id=7703) as Reference
  - To Practice you can try some Bug Bouny Hunt on programs use Mobile Apps
